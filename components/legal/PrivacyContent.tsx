        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Account:</b> your email address and name, from Google (see &ldquo;Signing in with Google&rdquo; below) or
            the email you sign in with; or your mobile number, if you sign in with it.</li>
          <li><b>Mobile number:</b> if you give it or verify it with an SMS code (sent by MSG91), and whether you agreed to
            hear about offers on it. Free credits need a verified number, and a verified number belongs to one account only.</li>
          <li><b>Photos:</b> the photo of you and the photos of clothes you add, and the pictures we make from them. For a
            couple picture, also your partner&rsquo;s photo, which is kept and deleted exactly like yours. Each picture
            carries an &ldquo;AI-generated&rdquo; label and, inside the file, a note that it is AI-generated with its own ID
            (not your name, email or number), as Indian law requires.</li>
          <li><b>Payments:</b> the amount, date and UPI reference of your recharges, and the bank&rsquo;s credit message
            for that payment (which shows the payer&rsquo;s name or UPI ID).</li>
          <li><b>Usage:</b> your credits, try-ons and recharges, and basic technical logs (time, errors).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why we use it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To make your try-on pictures and show them to you.</li>
          <li>To keep your credit balance and confirm your payments.</li>
          <li>To give the monthly free credits to one verified mobile number, and stop the same number getting them twice.</li>
          <li>To keep the service secure and answer your questions or complaints.</li>
          <li>To call or message you about your payments, pictures or account, if you gave your mobile number.</li>
          <li>To send you offers and news on WhatsApp or SMS, only if you ticked the box for it. You can untick it or
            remove your number any time from the account menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your data, show advertising, or use your photos to train AI models.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Photos and pictures:</b> deleted 3 days after you add them. You can delete all of them at once with
            &ldquo;Delete all my photos now&rdquo; in My pictures.</li>
          <li><b>Pictures you save or share:</b> a picture you download or share is a copy outside our systems. We cannot
            delete it and are not responsible for what happens to it (Terms, section 7).</li>
          <li><b>Account and credits:</b> kept while your account is open, and deleted when you delete your account.</li>
          <li><b>Payments:</b> the amount, date and UPI reference of your recharges and the bank&rsquo;s message for them
            are kept as long as tax and accounting law requires (usually 8 years), without your name or email once you
            delete your account.</li>
          <li><b>After you delete your account or change your verified number:</b> if you used free credits this month
            with a verified mobile number, we keep a one-way code made from that number (not the number itself) until the end of the month, so the same
            number does not get that month&rsquo;s free credits twice. Then it is deleted.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
